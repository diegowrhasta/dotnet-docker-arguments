# Introduction

This is a small project that aims at testing out two different ways of passing down 
some sort of argument to a docker container so that the application running on it 
changes its behavior (receives said argument).

- Passed down as a variable the moment the docker image is built.
- Through the override of env variables in the form of a `.env` file.

## Variables passed down on image build
